# K-NEAREST-NEIGHBORS

### IMPLEMENTION OF K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT INCOME

- The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm
- It can be used to solve both classification and regression problems
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using  K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
